HEAPS

It is a complete binary tree data that satisfies heap data structures
It is usually used to complete priority queues, where the smallest and the largest 
element is always at the root of the tree

Advantages of Heaps

It is efficient in insertion and deletion
Efficient priority queue
There is guaranteed access to the max and min element
It is space efficiency
It has worst-case time complexity on the heap-sort-algorithm 

Disadvantages of Heaps

It lacks flexibility
It is not ideal for searching
It has no stable data structures
Less memory management since it is error-prone
